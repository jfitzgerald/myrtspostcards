I went to Santa Cruz on the 4th had a swell time. Went down with my brother and his bunch. I went blackberry hunting yesterday with a bunch of girls from San Jose. We drove a cow up to the edge of the woods where nobody could see us and had berries and cream.I mean berries and milk. Some scheme. I am going to bring my brother up with me this next trip he is going to spend his vacation up here. This is certainly god's country in the woods are glorious. I got some small fir, hemlock and cedar trees in the woods and am going to bring them to San Jose with me when I come home. My brother is going to meet me at the boat when it comes in and work for me, so that I can spend my birthday in S.J. May come out to the house, Mon, July 15. Write [?]. the 1st boat on other side with wireless is mine. Same address, Will",
