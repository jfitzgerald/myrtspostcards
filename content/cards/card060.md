  "message" : "Nov1, '10 Thanks for the pretty flower post card you sent me. What kind of a flower do you call it? I think I saw some with Buffalo Bill's show when I was in S.J. A pretty good picture of me don't you think? Ha! Ha! I just know I would have looked handsome in the rig you described. I wish I could have been there. I would make it \"Hurrah\" for the \"Sheet & Pillow case\" I had. I had a fine ten mile horse back ride before sun up yesterday am. It was fine but Oh! wasn't it cold! I should say it was. I had icicles on my mustache. W.C.F. Te! He!",
