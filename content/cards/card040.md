I hope you'll say good bye before you go to Europe. I think you really ought to go to some foreign country as you have studied so hard that I just know your health must be failing. Turn about is fair play isn't it. I expect to go to the Hawaiian Islands on my honeymoon in April 1912. Regards from W.C.F.",
