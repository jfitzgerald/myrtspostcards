  "message" : "Oct.9,1910. My dear Myrtle (Lovey Dove) Received your postal and was very much surprised and had begun to think that you had passed from the land of the living. I wish to inform you that I haven't a \"He\" anymore. Were you here in Paly last week, saw PHylis about a week ago and she said she expected you up. Algebra is worse than ever this year. I got 40 on the last exam. McMahon got 20. Smart people we are. Honey Bunch",
