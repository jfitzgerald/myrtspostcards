I am going up into the northern part of the state on my vacation, into Siskiyou Co. Did you have a reconciliation with E. Brown before you left Paly? (curiosity killed a cat you [?]). Just think, we have just a little over a month before school starts. It will be so lonesome without you. I don't know what I will do. With Love, Honey Bunch",
