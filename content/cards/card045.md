McNewton's address is 11 Saveleer Ave. you said that I asked no questions. I did. I asked what school that Hazel is going to go to? Please answer.",

  "cover" : "Painting of women in red shirt and skirt and rifle; I wish that there was some good theater in this old town, as moving picture shows are tiresome. They have vaudeville at the [?] now. I am going up into the northern part of the state on my vacation, into Siskiyou Co. Did you have a reconciliation with E. Brown before you left Paly? (curiosity killed a cat you [?]). Just think, we have just a little over a month before school starts. It will be so lonesome without you. I don't know what I will do. With Love, Honey Bunch",
