  "message" : "Dec 13, 1910, Card received. Thanks. Now what have I done that makes me a dandy or the limit. Yes I am still plowing. Now I didn't have the necessary mill to secure either of those positions. I am sorry I wasn't there as maybe I could have induced you to teach me to dance. I guess my feet are too large though. Yes I still ride horseback altho not as much as I used to. I surely won't forget that promised ride even if I have forgot how to spell. Wishing you a Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year from your friend, W.T.",
