The \"her\" that you spoke of has turned me down good and proper. \"how jolly\"! I haven't heard from S.J. except from my sister, for a long whikle. One of my sisters began work in the 5-10-10 cent store last Monday. Do you ever see her. Light hair. About your height. Freckles. Now will you know her. Regards from W.C.F.",
