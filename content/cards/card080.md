  "message" : "King City, Cal 6/22<br>Well I'm tired of waiting for a card so will send another. Hos is San jose and the P.S.B? King City is fine. The \"her\" that you spoke of has turned me down good and proper. \"how jolly\"! I haven't heard from S.J. except from my sister, for a long whikle. One of my sisters began work in the 5-10-10 cent store last Monday. Do you ever see her. Light hair. About your height. Freckles. Now will you know her. Regards from W.C.F.",
