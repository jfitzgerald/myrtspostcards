Makes it kind of disagreeable all around. Am going to get onto the Seattle Wirless station and work a 8 hr night trick from 4pm to midnight and this fall, I intend to attend the Washington University in daytime. I guess old S.J. is abt the same as ever. [shorthand characters] I don't know where [?] you can/read this or not make a try. U poor little [orfing?] I feel so sorry 4 u. May see u when I get back to old S.J> Well so long. Sincerely Will.",
